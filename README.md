# filecoin energy estimation

This project was created during the 
Sustainable Blockchain Hackathon
in the 'Best Proof Of Energy Consumption Script' statement.

The script is more a learning experiment than a production solution. It 
helped me to explore the filecoin environment.

Infura https://infura.io/dashboard was chosen as the date source. 
The other recommended approaches, such as using Lilly, Estuary 
or downloading data dumps from AWS, were considered to be too 
expensive for the purpose.

The digital-MOD filescraper project was the main source of 
inspiration. https://github.com/Digital-MOB-Filecoin/filscraper/blob/main/lotus.js
